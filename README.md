Click start listening, and make sure to have earphones/buds in and a working microphone. Disable all ad blockers. As you speak in a conversation, it will play a tts voice in your ear, with useful information to the conversation:

ie. (what program hears) "I wonder how old this is if it says it was made in Yugoslavia?" "Yeah, good question"
